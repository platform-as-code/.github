# Platform as Code

## Introduction

The goal of our organization is to build the next generation of PaaS (Platform As A Service) using Platform as Code technology (platform.yaml file at the root the git repository). This way, developers can easily configure all their environments without leaving their source code and deploy & run their web applications as simple as a git push.

## Getting started

We will release very soon a first version of the platform (v0.1.0) where you will be able register and try to deploy your web application for free.
